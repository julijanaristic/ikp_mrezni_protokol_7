VS Code + WSL (Linux)

~How to install WSL?
In PowerShell (Run as Administrator):
wsl --status

If it's not installed:
wsl --install
Then you need to restart your computer. (and check wsl --status just in case)

~In VS Code:
1. Extensions -> install "WSL" (by Microsoft)
2. Ctrl + Shift + P
3. type: WSL: Open Folder in WSL
4. Open folder project
(in left corner it should write WSL: Ubuntu, it's the sign that project is opened in Ubuntu)

**maybe on the 3. step it will say that it cannot open in ubuntu,
because it is not there, then a small window will appear in the lower right corner, 
and click on the button that offers. It will switch to the above input and you need to type ubuntu and click on it.
(plain Ubuntu) Then it will install Ubuntu to your VS Code.
After this, go back to step 2!

~How to start the server?
Type in the terminal
1. Move to the folder 'server' -> cd server
2. g++ server.cpp accept/server_accept.cpp container/client_map.cpp socket/server_socket.cpp thread_pool/thread_pool.cpp -o server_app -pthread
3. ./server_app

If you see:
[SERVER] Listening on port 8080
Then server is working correctly.

**maybe you'll have a problem again at the second step when it complains that there's no g++.
Then it offers you to type: sudo apt install g++
If Ubuntu installed an older version, at the end you will see errors that it did not manage to install g++ all the way.
Then you need to perform the following steps:
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt upgrade -y  (if step 1 has no errors)
3. sudo apt install g++ -y  (if step 2 has no errors)
4. Go back to step 2 (How to start the server? step 2: g++ server.cpp server_socket.cpp -o server)
